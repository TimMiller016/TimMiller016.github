    <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-8 col-xs-8"><p>Geese are waterfowl belonging to the tribe Anserini
    of the family Anatidae. This tribe comprises the genera Anser (the grey
    geese), Branta (the black geese) and Chen (the white geese).
    Some other birds, mostly related to the shelducks,
    have "goose" as part of their names. More distantly related members of
    the family Anatidae are swans, most of which are larger than true geese,
    and ducks, which are smaller. The word "goose" is a direct descendent of
    Proto-Indo-European root, *ghans-. In Germanic languages, the root gave Old
    English gōs with the plural gēs and gandres (becoming Modern English goose,
    geese, gander, and gosling, respectively), Frisian goes, gies and guoske, New
    High German Gans, Gänse, and Ganter, and Old Norse gās. This term also gave
    Lithuanian žąsìs, Irish gé (goose, from Old Irish géiss), Latin anser, Greek χήν/khēn,
    Dutch gans, Albanian gatë (heron), Sanskrit hamsa and hamsi, Finnish hanhi,
    Avestan zāō, Polish gęś, Ukrainian гуска and гусак, Russian гусыня and гусь,
    Czech husa, and Persian ghāz. The term goose applies to the female in particular,
    while gander applies to the male in particular. Young birds before fledging
    are called goslings. The collective noun for a group of geese on the ground
    is a gaggle; when in flight, they are called a skein, a team, or a wedge; when
    flying close together, they are called a plump.</p>

      <div class="col-md-12"><br><p>The three living genera of true geese are: Anser, grey
       geese, including the greylag goose, and domestic geese; Chen, white geese
       (often included in Anser); and Branta, black geese, such as the Canada goose.
       Two genera of "geese" are only tentatively placed in the Anserinae; they may
       belong to the shelducks or form a subfamily on their own: Cereopsis, the Cape
       Barren goose, and Cnemiornis, the prehistoric New Zealand goose. Either these
       or, more probably, the goose-like Coscoroba swan is the closest living relative
       of the true geese.
       Fossils of true geese are hard to assign to genus; all that can be said is
       that their fossil record, particularly in North America, is dense and comprehensively
       documents many different species of true geese that have been around since about 10
       million years ago in the Miocene. The aptly named Anser atavus (meaning "progenitor goose")
       from some 12 million years ago had even more plesiomorphies in common with swans.
       In addition, some goose-like birds are known from subfossil remains found on the
       Hawaiian Islands. Geese are monogamous, living in permanent pairs throughout the year;
       however, unlike most other permanently monogamous animals, they are territorial only
       during the short nesting season. Paired geese are more dominant and feed more,
       two factors that result in more young.</p>

          <ul>Well-known sayings about geese include:<br><br>

            <li>To "have a gander" is to examine something in detail.</li>
            <br>
            <li>"What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander" means that what is appropriate treatment for one person is  	     equally appropriate for someone else.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Saying that someone's "goose is cooked" means that they have suffered, or are about to suffer, a terrible setback or 	     misfortune.</li>
            <br>
            <li>"Killing the goose that lays the golden eggs," derived from an old fable, is a saying referring to any greed-		     motivated, unprofitable action that destroys or otherwise renders a favorable situation useless.</li>
            <br>
            <li>"A wild goose chase" is a useless, futile waste of time and effort.
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>There is a legendary old woman called Mother Goose who wrote nursery rhymes for children.</li>
